	<h1>Magic: The Gathering, Not Just A Card Game </h1> <!-- Heading one -->
	
	
		<h2>Magic: A Brief Introduction </h2> <!-- heading 2 -->
	
			<p>First published in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast, Magic was the first trading card game produced and it continues to thrive, with approximately twelve million players as of 2011. 
			Magic can be played by two or more players each using a deck of 60+ printed cards or a deck of virtual cards through the Internet-based Magic: The Gathering Online or other programs.</p>

			<p>Each game represents a battle between wizards known as "planeswalkers", who employ spells, artifacts, and creatures depicted on individual Magic cards to defeat their opponents. 
			Although the original concept of the game drew heavily from the motifs of traditional fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, the gameplay of Magic bears little 
			similarity to pencil-and-paper adventure games, while having substantially more cards and more complex rules than many other card games.</p>
		
		Playing The Game   <!-- heading level 2-->
		
		In a game of Magic, two or more players are engaged in a battle as powerful wizards called "planeswalkers". A player starts the game with twenty "life points" and loses when he
		or she is reduced to zero. Players lose life when they are dealt "damage" by being attacked with summoned creatures or when spells or other cards cause them to lose life directly.
		A player can also lose if he or she must draw from an empty deck (called the "library" during the game). In addition, some cards specify other ways to win or lose the game.
		
		Players begin the game by shuffling their decks and then drawing seven cards. Players draw one card at the beginning of each of their turns, except the first 
		player on their first turn. Players alternate turns consisting of several phases. Most cards can only be played during the main phase of the player's own turn. 
		The player whose turn it is always has the first chance to play cards. At the end of a player's turn, if that player has more than seven cards in hand, 
		the player discards until their hand contains seven cards. The contents of other players' decks and hands are not usually known to players.
		
		Constructing Your Deck <!--heading level 2 -->
		 
		Each player needs a deck to play a game of Magic. In most tournament formats, decks are required to be a minimum of sixty cards, with no upper limit.
		Players may use no more than four copies of any named card, with the exception of "basic lands", which act as a standard resource in Magic, 
		and some specific cards that state otherwise. In "limited" tournament formats, where a small number of cards are opened for play from booster packs or tournament packs, 
		a minimum deck size of forty cards is used. Depending on the type of play, some cards have been "restricted" (the card is limited to a single copy per deck) or "banned" 
		(the card is no longer legal for tournament play).These limitations are usually for balance of power reasons, but have been occasionally made because of gameplay mechanics.
		
		The Colors of Magic <!--heading Level 3 --> 
		
			To play a spell of a given color, at least one mana of that color is required. This mana is normally generated by a basic land: plains for white, island for blue,
			swamp for black, mountain for red, and forest for green. The balances and distinctions among the five colors form one of the defining aspects of the game. 
			Each color has strengths and weaknesses based on the "style" of magic it represents.
			
				Black the color of power, ambition, greed, death, illness, corruption, selfishness, amorality, and sacrifice; it is not necessarily evil, though many of its cards refer directly or indirectly to this concept.<!--make a list here strong the colors -->
				White is the color of order, equality, righteousness, healing, law, community, peace, absolutism/totalitarianism, and light.
				Blue is the color of intellect, reason, illusion, logic, knowledge, manipulation, and trickery, as well as the classical elements of air and water.
				Green is the color of life, nature, reality, evolution/adaptability, ecology, interdependence, instinct, and indulgence.
				Red is the color of freedom, chaos, passion, creativity, impulse, fury, warfare, lightning, the classical element of fire, and the non-living geological aspects of the classical element earth.
